# Plane Trax 

### About the project
Uses ADS-B data transmitted from aircraft to generate a count of takeoffs and landings (operations) at a given airport.
 
This uses data from an ADS-B receiver located near the airport and is designed to be
executed on the same Raspberry Pi as the receiver.
 
The aircraft position messages generated by dump1090 and dump978 are read by planetrax.php using json files on the Raspberry Pi configured as the receiver.

It is determined whether the aircraft position, heading, and altitude represent a takeoff or landing for a given runway at a given airport.

Since multiple messages will be received from dump1090 and dump978 for each takeoff and landing sequence, it is determined whether an operation has already been logged for this sequence or if this is a duplicate.  If not a duplicate, an entry is written to the ops table in the database.
 
Optionally, log entries are written to the ops_log table in the database for all aircraft within a defined area.  This is used for debugging purposes.

Determining the latitude / longitude limits for each runway for the airport is a key requirement for the logging to function accurately.  

See the included file "install.docx" for installation instructions.

Installation Note: The instructions were compiled as the first installation was made and have not been tested.  Inconsistencies will likely be found in those using them.  

### Prerequisites
1. An ADS-B receiver near the airport to be tracked.  This should be running on a Raspberry pi with dump1090 and / or dump978 installed.  This was tested on ADS-B Exchange build 8.2.220910 executing on a Raspberry Pi 4 but will likely work with other feeders.  See https://www.adsbexchange.com/share-your-data/adsbx-custom-pi-image/#google_vignette for installation instructions for the feeder.

2. PHP v7.4.33 or later

3. php7.4-mysql

4. MariaDB 10.5.23 or later

5. Web server - This was tested with lighttpd but others should work as well.
